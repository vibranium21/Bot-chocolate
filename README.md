# Bot-chocolate
 Study of me playing (and judging) The bot: https://lichess.org/study/wRLbZWZU/u5FmfuBi Please note that the early games are painful.

  # Features:
  -Minimax and AlphaBeta pruning
  -testing board to play engine on(although the engine is very slow on my intel i3)
  -Basic Evaluation(Piece values, Piece placement)

  # Issues:
  -Engine is very slow at high depth(expected but still unideal)
  -Even at higher depths, occasionally makes very questionable moves.

  # Future-Features:
  -Playing it on Lichess
  -Better evaluation
  -More efficient move generation
